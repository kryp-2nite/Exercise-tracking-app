Exercise Tracking App allows the user to track your daily workout routines easily. This app allows the user to input the type of workout the user did, how many sets and reps along with the weight you were lifting for that particular exercise. Also we have added a notes section for the user in case they want to write how they felt about their workout for that particular day as well.

Some of the technology that we used for this app to work was
    -Express
    -node.js
    -mongoDB
    -mongoose
    -CSS
    -Google Oauth

The approach that Mehari and I came up with was to tackle the data first. We first had to brainstorm what kind of data do we want to track in our app since that is going to be the most vital part of how our app functions. Once we figured out the data we wanted, we hit the ground running and never looked back.

Mehari and I are very proud of how our project turned out since this being our first backend project and there were a lot of bumps along the way. Some of the issues we were having was with the google oauth, our update user function and the add notes function. Eventually we were able to solve these problems but it took us some time to figure them out.

Overall, this project was hard to do but fun at the same time. We got to learn the ins and outs of backend development and we could see ourselves doing a similar project to this one in the near future.
